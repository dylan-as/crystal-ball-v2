this is meant to be an introductory web application for additional practice with integrating javascript into static html/css. I initially completed this project for ame 220 @ asu (programming for the web) and want to revisit it now that I have a better understanding of structuring cohesive and semantic html, as well as a better grasp on effective, ux-first styling. 
this app is meant to serve as a virtual magic 8 ball - the user enters a yes or no question, and one of twenty randomzied responses populates as an answer.

7-2: 
restyling is done! additional things I'd like to add: 
 - text input that resizes dynamically based on ch#
 - completed portfolio to link (lol)
 - credits page (open source bg image/vid)
